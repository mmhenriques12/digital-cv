  My journey so far has been about discovering how I can positively impact peoples' lives both in- and outside work. I am a big enthusiast of the techüåç and passionate about crafting more transparent, agile and more human-centric workplaces always with smart and awesome people by my side ‚ù§Ô∏è Currently learning and doing this at [Valispace](https://www.valispace.com/). Otherwise you can find me doing cool stuff like:
  
    - Taking long walks (or simply cuddling) with my dog üê∂ 
    - Roller skating üõº
    - Tapestry in weaving for wall decor or ceramics üé®

          The very beginning of my Recruitment career journey. Learned a lot about myself, my beliefs and interests which led me to abandon Human Resources in old school environments, and instead to join People teams in fast-paced, modern startups.

          An international business and hospitality university based in the Netherlands. The typical clich√©: loved studying abroad, it taught me much about resilience but nop! I'm not going to work in the field I studied.
