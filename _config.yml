  My journey so far has been about discovering how I can positively impact peoples' lives both in- and outside work. I am a big enthusiast of the tech🌍 and passionate about crafting more transparent, agile and more human-centric workplaces always with smart and awesome people by my side ❤️ Currently learning and doing this at [Valispace](https://www.valispace.com/). Otherwise you can find me doing cool stuff like:
  
    - Taking long walks (or simply cuddling) with my dog 🐶 
    - Roller skating 🛼
    - Tapestry in weaving for wall decor or ceramics 🎨

         Currently helping to build an agile, modern and human People department to guide Valispace's growth 🚀 Besides hiring and onboarding, I'm developing and implementing people-driven strategies and programs that help everyone feel supported and enabled to do their best work.
