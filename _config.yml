about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  My journey so far has been about discovering how I can positively impact peoples' lives both in- and outside work, within the tech🌍 
# I am passionate about crafting more transparent and more human-centric workplaces (& I love seeing how businesses benefit from these!) always with amazing people by my side ❤️ 
# I'm currently doing this at [Valispace](https://www.valispace.com/) 🚀 When not doing this, you can find me doing cool things like:
  
    - Taking long walks (or simply cuddling) with my dog 🐶 
    - Roller skating 🛼
    - Tapestry in weaving for wall decor or ceramics 🎨

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
